A strong desire to influence the world around me drives me to expand knowledge  and continually learn new technologies. I want to exploit new bleeding edge technologies to provide incredible value and a phenomenal experience. The journey to become a great developer is paved blood, the hope of this blog is to catalog my journey. Keep as a reference and a reminder of how far I still have to go. And it be great if anyone else finds it useful.

I'm not definitely not a great developer I'd have trouble even saying I'm a good
developer, but also not a total newbie. The hope for this blog is to encapsulate
everything I'm interested, learning, or building. This should be a resource
primarily for myself in turn helpful to others hoping to better their craft.
